# About

This project is made by two engineering students looking to make the cockpit of a FA18-C Hornet that would be usable for the game DCS.

# Tools

Already existing tools will be used for this project.

## Platformio

Platformio is used in order to compile and transfer the project onto the ESP32.

## OpenHornet

The CAD made by the team of ![OpenHornet](https://openhornet.com/) will be reused to make our own cockpit.

## DCS-Bios

For the communication between the simulation and the computer, ![DCS-Bios](https://github.com/DCS-Skunkworks/dcs-bios/blob/main/Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/userguide.adoc#reference_tool) will be the solution. 

## Adafruit-PCF8574

![Adafruit-PCF8574](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_PCF8574/tree/main/examples) will be used to communicate with the different extenders.

# Goals

We aim to make the cockpit but by using switches designed by us and by using the less electronic cards possible.
