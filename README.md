# About

This project is made by two engineering students looking to make the cockpit of a FA18-C Hornet that would be usable for the game DCS.

# Tools

Already existing tools will be used for this project.

## Platformio

Platformio is used in order to compile and transfer the project onto the ESP32.

## OpenHornet

The CAD made by the team of ![OpenHornet](https://openhornet.com/) will be reused to make our own cockpit.

## DCS-Bios

For the communication between the simulation and the computer, ![DCS-Bios](https://github.com/DCS-Skunkworks/dcs-bios/blob/main/Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/userguide.adoc#reference_tool) will be the solution. 

## Adafruit-PCF8574

![Adafruit-PCF8574](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_PCF8574/tree/main/examples) will be used to communicate with the different extenders.

# Goals

We aim to make the cockpit but by using switches designed by us and by using the less electronic cards possible.

# Contributing

As it is a school project, we don't aim to have help in this project. However, if you want to persue this project, feel free to contact me. I'll be glad to tell you more.
