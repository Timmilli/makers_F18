# Installation

The ZIPs in this directory are all used differently.

## dcs-bios-0.8.3.zip

This one is used to have the last version (at the time of the projet) of DcsBios.

It is on this one that the plane function definitions are based on.

## dcs-bios-0.8.0.zip

This one is used only for the .json of the planes that are then moved to :
```bash
./Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/json/
```

## dcs-bios-arduino-library-0.3.10.zip

This one is the arduino library of DcsBios. 

This should then be unzip into the directory containing your other arduino librairies.
